# lacky

A CLI tool to run a GitHub Actions Workflow locally.


## What it does

1. **YAML Validation**: First validates the YAML syntax of the workflow file
2. **Structure Analysis**: Analyzes the workflow structure and reports:
   - Workflow name
   - Triggers (on events)
   - Jobs defined
   - Warnings for missing elements
3. **Interactive Job Selection**: Prompts before running each job (y/n/a/q/s):
   - Choose whether to run or skip individual jobs
   - Run all remaining jobs without prompting (a)
   - Quit workflow execution at any time (q)
   - Helpful for debugging specific jobs in complex workflows
   - Conditions are still evaluated (jobs may be skipped if conditions aren't met)
4. **Simulation**: Simulates the workflow execution by:
   - Running each job sequentially
   - Displaying job details (runs-on, steps)
   - Simulating step execution with timing
   - Showing step names and types
5. **Interactive Variable Resolution**: Prompts for GitHub context variables with smart defaults:
   - Menu-based selection for known variables (e.g., `github.ref_type` offers "branch" or "tag")
   - Free-text input for custom variables and inputs
   - Caches resolved values to avoid repeated prompts
6. **Workflow Functions Support**: Supports GitHub Actions workflow expression functions:
   - `always()` - Always returns true (runs job/step regardless of previous results)
   - `success()` - Returns true (assumes previous steps/jobs succeeded)
   - `failure()` - Returns false (for testing failure conditions)
   - `cancelled()` - Returns false (for testing cancellation conditions)
7. **Tool Version Management with mise**: Automatically detects and uses mise for environment management:
   - Runs workflow commands with the correct tool versions from `.mise.toml` or `.tool-versions`
   - Seamlessly integrates with your existing mise configuration
   - Falls back to system tools if mise is not installed
8. **Mock Actions**: Supports custom mock actions for testing workflows locally

## Installation

### Pre-built Binaries (Recommended)

Download the latest release for your platform from the [GitHub Releases page](https://github.com/codecapers/lacky/releases).

#### Linux
```bash
# Download and extract
curl -L https://github.com/codecapers/lacky/releases/latest/download/lacky-linux-x64.tar.gz | tar xz

# Make executable and move to PATH
chmod +x lacky
sudo mv lacky /usr/local/bin/
```

#### macOS (Intel)
```bash
# Download and extract
curl -L https://github.com/codecapers/lacky/releases/latest/download/lacky-macos-x64.tar.gz | tar xz

# Remove quarantine attributes (required for unsigned binaries)
xattr -c lacky

# Make executable and move to PATH
chmod +x lacky
sudo mv lacky /usr/local/bin/
```

#### macOS (Apple Silicon)
```bash
# Download and extract
curl -L https://github.com/codecapers/lacky/releases/latest/download/lacky-macos-arm64.tar.gz | tar xz

# Remove quarantine attributes (required for unsigned binaries)
xattr -c lacky

# Make executable and move to PATH
chmod +x lacky
sudo mv lacky /usr/local/bin/
```

**macOS Security Note**: If you encounter "cannot be opened because the developer cannot be verified" or similar security warnings, you need to remove the quarantine attributes that macOS adds to downloaded files:

```bash
xattr -c ./lacky
```

This is required because macOS Gatekeeper automatically quarantines downloaded binaries that aren't code-signed by a registered Apple developer. The `xattr -c` command removes these extended attributes, allowing the binary to run normally. This is safe for trusted binaries like lacky.

#### Windows
1. Download `lacky-windows-x64.zip` from the [releases page](https://github.com/codecapers/lacky/releases)
2. Extract the archive
3. Add the extracted folder to your PATH or run `lacky.exe` directly

### Development Installation

If you want to build from source or contribute to development:

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/codecapers/lacky.git
cd lacky

# Install Bun (if not already installed)
curl -fsSL https://bun.sh/install | bash

# Install dependencies
bun install

# Run in development mode
bun run dev -- workflow.yml
```

## Usage

### Basic Usage

```bash
# Run a workflow file
lacky .github/workflows/test.yml

# Preview mode (dry-run) - shows what commands would be executed
lacky --dry-run .github/workflows/test.yml

# Show version
lacky --version

# Show help
lacky --help
```

### Interactive Experience

When you run a workflow, lacky will interactively prompt you:

1. **Job Selection**: Before each job, you'll be asked whether to run it
   ```
   Do you want to run job 'build'? (y/n/a/q/s):
   ```
   - `y` (yes) - Run this job
   - `n` (no) - Skip this job
   - `a` (all) - Run this and all remaining jobs without asking
   - `q` (quit) - Stop workflow execution
   - `s` (skip) - Skip this job

2. **Variable Input**: When GitHub context variables are encountered
   - Menu selection for known variables (e.g., `github.ref_type`)
   - Text input with helpful placeholders for others (e.g., `github.ref_name`)

3. **Command Confirmation**: For each command (unless running with `--dry-run` or choosing "run all")
   - Option to run, skip, run all remaining, or quit

This interactive approach gives you fine-grained control over workflow execution, perfect for debugging specific jobs or steps.

### Testing Lacky on Its Own Workflow

You can use Lacky to test itself by running it against its own release workflow:

```bash
bun run start -- .github/workflows/release.yml
```

This is a great way to:
- Test Lacky's functionality with a real-world workflow
- Debug issues in your CI/CD pipeline locally
- Understand how Lacky handles complex workflows with multiple jobs, conditions, and matrices

### Development Mode (from source)

```bash
# Run with hot reload
bun run dev -- <workflow-file>

# Run tests
bun run test

# Run tests in watch mode
bun run test:watch

# Type check
bun run compile
```

## Interactive Variable Resolution

When lacky encounters GitHub context variables in your workflow (like `${{ github.ref_type }}`), it will interactively prompt you for values using Inquirer for an enhanced user experience. For known variables with specific valid options, lacky presents an interactive menu to choose from:

### Menu-Based Variables

The following variables offer interactive menu-based selection:

- **`github.ref_type`**: Choose between "branch" or "tag"
- **`github.event_name`**: Choose from common event types like "push", "pull_request", "workflow_dispatch", etc.

Example interaction:
```
? Select value for 'github.ref_type': (Use arrow keys)
‚ùØ branch
  tag

      üîß Resolved github.ref_type = "branch"
```

### Free-Text Input Variables

Other variables will prompt for free-text input with helpful placeholders:
- **`github.ref_name`**: Branch or tag name (e.g., `main`)
- **`github.sha`**: Commit SHA (e.g., `abc123def456`)
- **`github.workspace`**: Workspace path (e.g., `/home/runner/work/repo/repo`)
- **`github.event.inputs.*`**: Workflow dispatch inputs (e.g., `my-value`)
- **`env.*`**: Environment variables (e.g., `value`)

Example interaction:
```
? Enter branch/tag name (main)
```

Press Enter to use the default placeholder value, or type your own value.

### Variable Caching

Once you provide a value for a variable, lacky caches it for the duration of the workflow execution. This means you won't be prompted multiple times for the same variable.

### Try It Out

You can test the interactive variable resolution with the included example workflow:

```bash
lacky examples/example-workflow.yml
```

This will prompt you to select values for `github.ref_type` and `github.event_name`, demonstrating the menu-based selection feature.

## Tool Version Management with mise

Lacky automatically integrates with [mise](https://mise.jdx.dev/) (formerly rtx) to ensure your workflow commands run with the correct tool versions. This is especially useful when your project requires specific versions of tools like Node.js, Python, Terraform, Go, etc.

### How It Works

1. **Automatic Detection**: When lacky starts, it checks if mise is installed on your system
2. **Version Display**: If mise is found, lacky displays the mise version at startup
3. **Command Execution**: All workflow commands are executed using `mise exec`, which:
   - Reads your `.mise.toml` or `.tool-versions` file
   - Activates the specified tool versions
   - Runs the command in that environment
4. **Graceful Fallback**: If mise is not installed, commands run using your system's default tool versions

### Setting Up mise for Your Project

If you haven't set up mise for your project yet:

1. **Install mise**:
   ```bash
   curl https://mise.run | sh
   ```

2. **Create a `.mise.toml` file** in your project root:
   ```toml
   [tools]
   node = "20.10.0"
   terraform = "1.6.0"
   python = "3.11"
   ```

   Or use a `.tool-versions` file (asdf-compatible):
   ```
   node 20.10.0
   terraform 1.6.0
   python 3.11
   ```

3. **Install the tools**:
   ```bash
   mise install
   ```

### Example

If your workflow runs `terraform plan` and you have this in `.mise.toml`:
```toml
[tools]
terraform = "1.6.0"
```

Lacky will execute it as:
```bash
mise exec -- terraform plan
```

This ensures the command uses Terraform 1.6.0, regardless of what version (if any) is installed system-wide.

### Benefits

- **Consistency**: Same tool versions locally and in CI/CD
- **Isolation**: Different projects can use different tool versions
- **Reproducibility**: Workflow behavior matches production environments
- **No Conflicts**: Avoid "works on my machine" issues

### Without mise

If you don't use mise, lacky will still work fine‚Äîit will just use whatever tool versions are available in your system PATH. The mise integration is completely optional but highly recommended for projects that depend on specific tool versions.

## Mock Actions

Lacky supports creating mock actions to simulate custom GitHub Actions locally. This is particularly useful for testing workflows that depend on external actions that aren't available in your local environment.

### Creating Mock Actions

To create a mock action, follow these steps:

1. **Create the mock directory structure**:
   ```
   .github/
   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ workflows/
       ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ mocks/
           ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ {workflow-name}/
               ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ {action-name}.js
   ```

2. **Name your mock file**: Convert the action name to a filename by replacing `/` with `-`:
   - `tj-actions/changed-files` ‚Üí `tj-actions-changed-files.js`
   - `actions/checkout` ‚Üí `actions-checkout.js`
   - `my-org/my-action` ‚Üí `my-org-my-action.js`

3. **Create the mock function**: Your mock file should export a function that returns the expected outputs:

   ```javascript
   // .github/workflows/mocks/my-workflow.yml/tj-actions-changed-files.js
   export default async function mockChangedFiles({ step, workflow, workingDir, stepId, isDryRun }) {
       // Return the mocked outputs
       return {
           all_changed_files: 'path/to/changed/file.txt',
           any_changed: 'true',
           only_modified: 'false'
       };
   };
   ```

### Mock Function Parameters

The mock function receives the following parameters:

- `step`: The workflow step object containing the action configuration
- `workflow`: The entire workflow object
- `workingDir`: The working directory for the step
- `stepId`: The unique identifier for the step
- `isDryRun`: Boolean indicating if this is a dry run

### Example: Mock for tj-actions/changed-files

```javascript
// .github/workflows/mocks/validate-tf-route-53-plan.yaml/tj-actions-changed-files.js
export default async function mockChangedFiles({ step, workflow, workingDir, stepId, isDryRun }) {
    // Return the mocked outputs
    return {
        all_changed_files: 'the/changed/file'
    };
};
```

### How Mock Actions Work

1. When lacky encounters a step with a `uses` property, it looks for a corresponding mock file
2. If a mock file exists, it loads and executes the mock function
3. The mock function's return value is used as the step's outputs
4. These outputs can be referenced in subsequent steps using `${{ steps.step-id.outputs.output-name }}`
5. If no mock file exists, lacky displays an informational message and continues

### Mock File Location

The mock system looks for mock files in this pattern:
```
.github/workflows/mocks/{workflow-filename-without-extension}/{action-name}.js
```

For example, if your workflow file is `validate-tf-route-53-plan.yaml` and you want to mock `tj-actions/changed-files`, create:
```
.github/workflows/mocks/validate-tf-route-53-plan.yaml/tj-actions-changed-files.js
```

## Development Scripts

- `bun run dev` - Run in development mode with hot reload
- `bun run start` - Run directly with Bun
- `bun run build` - Build TypeScript (type checking)
- `bun run test` - Run tests
- `bun run test:watch` - Run tests in watch mode
- `bun run test:coverage` - Run tests with coverage
- `bun run clean` - Remove build artifacts

## Building Executables

```bash
# Build for Linux
bun run build-linux

# Build for Windows
bun run build-win

# Build for macOS Intel
bun run build-mac-x64

# Build for macOS Apple Silicon
bun run build-mac-arm64
```

Executables will be created in the `bin/` directory.

## Deployment

### Creating a Release

Releases are automatically built and published via GitHub Actions when you push a version tag.

#### For Stable Releases

1. Update the version in `package.json`:
   ```bash
   # Edit package.json and update the version field
   # Example: "version": "0.0.4"
   ```

2. Commit the version change:
   ```bash
   git add package.json
   git commit -m "Bump version to 0.0.4"
   ```

3. Create and push a version tag:
   ```bash
   git tag v0.0.4
   git push origin main
   git push origin v0.0.4
   ```

4. The GitHub Actions workflow will:
   - Validate the version matches the tag
   - Run tests
   - Build executables for all platforms (Linux, Windows, macOS x64, macOS ARM64)
   - Create a GitHub release with all binaries

#### For Nightly Releases

Nightly releases are automatically created when you push to any branch without a tag:

```bash
git push origin main
```

This will create/update a nightly release with binaries built from the latest commit.

### Release Artifacts

Each release includes:
- `lacky-linux-x64.tar.gz` - Linux x64 executable
- `lacky-windows-x64.zip` - Windows x64 executable
- `lacky-macos-x64.tar.gz` - macOS Intel executable
- `lacky-macos-arm64.tar.gz` - macOS Apple Silicon executable
